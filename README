An R6RS library for xUnit

== Introduction

We propose an xUnit test utility (xunit) in which you can assert and
investigate if a testee program's behaviour satisfies expected requirements.
The way we recommend to specify expected requirements is in terms of
predicates and equivalence relations, because they are suitable to
detect fundamental properties of the dynamic environment of, and by,
Scheme programs.

(xunit) offers you useful macros which contain
* assertions for standard predicates and equivalence relations,
* 'define-assert-equivalence', defining a custom assertion on some
   equivalence relation, and
* 'define-assert-predicate', defining a custom assertion on some predicate.
